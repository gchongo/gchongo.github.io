Anincrease in the geometrical tolerance can obviously be applied when the feature to which the MMR requirement has to be applied is a feature of size (to which a dimensional tolerance can be associated), with an axis or a symmetry plane, such as a hole, a groove or a pin. The advantages that can be obtained pertain to an economy in the production, as a result of the enlargement of the limits of the tolerances, and a reduction in the wastes, since it is possible to accept features which, although the geometrical tolerances are not within the prescribed limits, in practice offer the same functional characteristics as the features achieved within the limits.

If the maximum material requirement is not indicated, the value of the straightness tolerance remains constant, since the value of the diameter varies from a maximum to a minimum, as a result of the independency principle.

MMR is generally chosen when the parts have to be assembled with a mating with clearance (i.e. fixed fastener), but it is useful to allow additional maximum tolerances to reduce the manufacturing costs.</p> <p>LMR is useful when a designer has the goal of guaranteeing a minimum distance or a critical wall thickness. RPR is used to enlarge the size tolerance, for example, in a non-functional assembly. Finally, RFS (without any modifier) is used when any additional tolerance, such as the control of a position tolerance of a locating pin, can compromise the functionality of the workpiece.</p> <p>It should be noted that, in many cases, an additional tolerance does not have any impact on the function, and therefore does not make the part work better. The additional variation allowed byMMRmay lead to a reduction in the cost ofmanufacturing parts, as it may allow certain functional parts to pass inspection.</p> <p>Figure 5.16 in fact shows a typical application in which it is appropriate to use the MMR to guarantee the correct position of a sensor, which is positioned by means of a screw. These parts have a fixed fastener mating, that is, one of the parts has a threaded hole, and the other has a clearance hole. In this case, the position of the sensor holder only depends on the threaded hole. The screw has a mating clearance with the plate (Fig. 5.17), and the clearance hole position error therefore does not affect the position of the sensor. In this case, any additional tolerance does not have an impact on the function, and it is convenient to specify the maximum material requirement.</p> <p>In the second case in Fig. 5.18, the sensor support is only positioned by means of a dowel pin, which allows mating with only a slight interference with the plate. However, the error in locating the hole in the platewill affect the position of the sensor, and it is therefore better not to further increase the amount of tolerance through the use of an MMR modifier (Fig. 5.19).</p> <p>In the latter case, the connection of the sensor support is obtained with a pin from the same support, which is connected, with a clearance fit, to the plate (Fig. 5.20). The worst condition, which affects the location of the sensor, occurswhen the hole has the maximum allowed dimensions LMS (and when the pin has the minimum allowed diameter LMS). In such a case, it is useful to use the LMR modifier. Figure 5.21 shows that when assuming an MMVS mating pin size of 12.8 mm and accepting a sensor position error of less than 1 mm, the hole is produced with a smaller size, and it is possible to increase the localisation tolerance so that the LMR requirement guarantees the minimum position error and the maximum admissible tolerance.</p> <p> Fig. 5.16 A fixed fastener assembly: the designer has the goal of guaranteeing the correct position of a sensor Fig. 5.17 The clearance hole position error does not affect the position of the sensor Fig. 5.18 The sensor support is only positioned by means of a dowel pin Fig. 5.19 A dowel pin which provides a mating with only a slight interference with the plate.

GD&amp;T, or GPS, is a language that is made up of symbols which can be used to accurately control tolerances, but it also allows the maximum manufacturing flexibility and control of the costs to be achieved.</p> <p>Real surfaces can in fact differ, to various extents, from the exact geometric form foreseen during the design phase, both as far as the geometric form is concerned and for the pre-established position with respect to other surfaces assumed as a reference, as a result of various factors (bending of the workpiece and of the tool during the tooling, vibrations of the machine, deformations during hardening, etc.).</p> <p> Fig. 1.1 The real surfaces of a constructed part may deviate to various extents from both the geometrically exact form indicated during the design phase and from the pre-established position with respect to surfaces or points assumed as a datum.</p> <p>The workpiece in Fig. 1.1 is shown with the form errors conveniently enlarged for explanatory purposes, but it can also appear as such for the instruments that perform precise measurements (such as the modern Coordinate Measuring Machines, CMM). </p> <p>Another example of form error is illustrated in Fig. 1.2: the sinuous trend of the workpiece or not detected by the measurement gauge, which locally ascertains, section by section, the values of the diameters that fall within the dimensional tolerance limits. However, it would be difficult to insert the workpiece easily into an axially extended hole, because the spatial dimension of the pin would be greater than that foreseen for the tolerance.</p> <p> Fig. 1.2 Evaluating the mating conditions by only referring to linear distances leads to the effects of the form being neglected: a smooth f/H shaft-hole mating is in practice forced if the roundness and straightness conditions are not adequate. In fact, the measured maximum dimension, d<sub>max</sub>, that conforms to the requested tolerance is less than the Dmax dimension that corresponds to the actual mating dimensions of the pin. Accordingly, it is not possible to fit the hinge pin with the hole because of the error in the straightness of the axis</p> <p>It is hence necessary to set adequate constraints on the straightness of the axis and on the roundness of the surface. It therefore seems evident that, when establishing the errors that are acceptable in the construction of a part, the form and dimensions should be evaluated considering the functional requirements. Above all, as the complexity of the designed objects increases, because of the numerous technological processes that are now utilized and because of the necessity of guaranteeing quality through careful inspections and verifications, the information that is derived from the project, and therefore from the design of the component that must be produced, should refer to all the sectors involved as much as possible. The drawings of the workpiece, as requested for the process, should not be ambiguous; the function of the parts, as well as the way of obtaining and controlling them should be completely included and reported.  In short, each feature of a workpiece should be fully defined in terms of dimension, position, orientation, and form. </p> <p>The tolerances, whether geometrical or dimensional, should be essential parts of the design process right from the beginning, and not just an accessory that has to be added only once the design has been completed.</p> <p>One procedure that can be adopted to satisfy these requirements is the functional dimensioning method, which can be defined as a way of specifying the geometric functionalities and the functional relationships that exist among the form characteristics, in a project or design, in order to obtain the most valid production from both a qualitative and an economic point of view.</p> <p>The components that have to be controlled and measured can be specificated through this method; in this way, the intentions of the designer are respected, and the manufacturer is able to choose the most appropriate manufacturing procedures.</p> <p>Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools, which have the purpose of generating, manipulating, and reporting the geometry of the parts that have to be produced, are currently used for design purposes, but they are not sufficient on their own to document an industrial product in an effective way.</p> <p>In order to communicate a precise and rigorous description of a part, not only should the dimensions be indicated in the engineering drawing, but also the admissible error, in terms of size, location, orientation and form.</p> <p>The term \u201cGeometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing\u201d (GD&amp;T) is often used to characterize a functional design. GD&amp;T is a language made up of symbols that are used to specify the limits of imperfection that can be tolerated in order to guarantee a correct assembly, as well as the univocal and repeatable functionality and control of the parts that have to be produced. Moreover, GD&amp;T is a tool that allows an imperfect geometry to be managed \u201cperfectly\u201d.</p> <p>The GD&amp;T method was developed and extended during the Second World War by Great Britain and the United States. The first publication concerning a standard, pertaining to the basic concepts of form and position,was published in Great Britain in 1948.1 In 1940, in theUnited States, Chevrolet printed a publication concerning position tolerances, and this was followed, in 1945, by amanual, which was published by the American Military administration, in which symbols were introduced to specify form and position tolerances. Over the following years, the ASA and SAE associations published their own standards, which, in 1966, took on the present forms, although they have periodically been updated (the most recent being in 2018). </p> <p>About 50 years ago, some companies in Europe began to introduce a few indications relative to admissible geometric errors, and the first mention of this topic appeared in texts on comparative design. In 1969, an ISO recommendation project introduced, at a normative level, the symbols that are used today. However, geometric tolerance was long considered an option that was only to be used in particular and rare occasions, that is, when the dimensional tolerances (which were generally considered suitable if accompanied by a correct execution) were not considered sufficient to define the exact form of a component.</p> <p>A different approach to tolerances, which couples geometric dimensioning with the functionality of a workpiece, is currently being developed, with the aim of obtaining a shared, clear and comprehensive language for all the production sectors interested in a particular project, and of reporting the finished conditions of the objects that have to be produced in a univocal and faithful way, with the intention of advantaging functionality and reducing costs. As already mentioned, this is not a recent method, but it has still not been fully exploited in many European countries, where the benefits that could be achieved, in practical terms, on the highly competitive markets of today, are often disregarded. </p> <p> Unfortunately, the technical product documentation that is currently drawn up in many companies is still ambiguous and often contains many errors, such as erroneous datums, imprecise or missing distances, as well as incongruent and difficult to check tolerances. These documents were in fact first conceived considering a series of standards that originated in the technical industrial context of the last century, that is, by referring to the then most widespread measurement instruments, such as gauges and micrometers, in which the measurements were made and expressed as the distance between two points. The most frequently used measurement method was that of coordinate dimensioning, where only the dimensional tolerances (that is, the \u201cplus or minus\u201d system), which could give rise to manufacturing and control ambiguity, were used. </p> <p>This methodology is in fact no longer results to be themost suitable for the requirements of the modern global productive realty, in which companies, for both strategic and market reasons, frequently resort to suppliers and producers who are located in different countries, and it is therefore necessary to make use of communication means in which the transfer of information is both univocal and rigorous.</p>","tags":["GT&T","GPS"]},{"location":"blog/CAD/Introducing%20GDT%20and%20GPS.html#12-traditional-dimensioning-example","title":"1.2 Traditional Dimensioning Example","text":"<p>Let us consider the drawing in Fig. 1.3 of a plate with 4 holes, for which the assembly with fixed fasteners is demonstrated as an example; the traditional measurement method has been applied to the plate, that is, with the 4 holes being located according to the dimensional tolerances.</p> <p> Fig. 1.3 Traditional dimensioning of a plate with 4 holes, for which the functional assembly conditions are shown (coherence of the profiles, perpendicularity of the profile, location of the holes, implied datums) Fig. 1.4 If themeasurement of the dimensions starts from the edges, which are not orientated at 90\u00b0, as shown in the drawing, how should the workpiece be arranged exactly to control the dimensional tolerance?

This standard involved the use of a standard sized shaft with various sizes of holes to establish the various types of fit. The standard, which was not initially regarded favourably by industry, since it was based on a shaft basis, was revised in 1924 on basis of the holes.</p> <p>In the United States, five engineering societies and three government agencies founded the American Engineering Standards Committee (AESC) in 1918, which then became the American Standards Association (ASA) in 1928 and which was reorganised as the United States of America Standards Institute (USASI) in 1966. Finally, the USASI became the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1969. The first standard on limits and fits was the American Tentative Standard Tolerances, Allowances, and Gages for Metal Fits, B4a-1925 which contained tables that listed eight series of fits between holes and shafts, each fit being specified by the limits of size for each of the two mating parts.</p> <p>The InternationalFederation of the National Standardizing Associations (or International Standards Association, ISA),was established in 1926, and one of the earliest projects was the development of an international system of limits and fits, which was published in 1941 as \u201cISA Tolerance System\u201d with all the data inmetric units. Several European countries adopted this system as the basis of their national standards.</p> <p>After the conclusion of World War II, a new organisation, the United Nations Standards Coordinating Committee (UNSCC), was established by the United States, Great Britain and Canada to extend the benefits of standardisation to the work of reconstruction. In October 1946, ISA and UNSCC delegates from 25 countries met in London and agreed to join forces to create the new International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO).

In 1957, ASME published the first dimensioning and tolerancing standard, that is, Y14.5\u20131957 for ASA. Subsequent revisions of the Y14.5 standard have been published as USASI (Y14.5\u20131966) and ANSI (Y14.5\u20131973 and Y14.5\u20131982).</p> <p>The revised ASME Y14.5 M-1994 (\u201cM\u201d because metric units were included) was approved as an ASME standard and, after fifteen years, was followed by ASME Y14.5\u20132009.

GPS is considered as a shared language between worlds that are often separate, that is, the design, production and the control worlds and, for the first time in the history of standards, it compares designers with metrologists. The ISO/TR 14638:1995 Masterplan document, which was issued in 1995 as a summary of the work of the Joint Harmonisation Group, was drawn up to outline the guidelines for ISO/TC 213. In fact, the Masterplan, which was later approved as the Global GPS Standard, ratifies the new paradigm for the classification of GPS standards. The entire system is known as the \u201cGPSMatrixModel\u201d, and it takes on the role of a \u201ccontainer\u201d of the GPS standards by acting as a matrix in which the lines refer to the geometrical properties of the product (for example, the form or location), while the columns represent the links or, in other words, a specific application ambit of the standards in the context of the development cycle of a product, from its conception to its final control (Fig. 4.2).</p> <p>A table is formed by crossing these dimensions: the GPS matrix, in which each standard is characterised by 2 coordinates (the properties and the production process step). A standard can often refer to more than one property, or to different steps of the production process; it can therefore take up an area of the matrix and not just a single cell. Each standard of the system includes a final attachment with the exact location of the standard in the matrix, which is indicated with a filled dot (Fig. 4.3).</p> <p>In the new Masterplan outlined in ISO 14638 of 2015, the GPS standards are classified as:</p> <ol> <li><p>Fundamental, that is, standards which define the rules and principles that apply to all categories and which occupy all the segments of the matrix (ISO 8015, ISO 14638).</p></li> <li><p>General, that is, ISO GPS standards that apply to one or more geometrical property categories, and to one or more chain links, but which are fundamental (ISO 1101, ISO 5459).</p></li> <li><p>Complementary, that is, ISO GPS standards that refer to specific manufacturing processes (for example, turning) or to specific machine elements (for example, bolts).</p> Fig. 4.2 GPS matrix model of the ISO 14638:2015 standard where the lines refer to a specific geometrical feature of the product, while the columns represent the application environments of the standards in the product development cycle context Fig. 4.3 Each standard is characterised by 2 coordinates in the matrix, but can often refer to more than one property, or different steps of the production process, and may thus occupy an area of the matrix rather than just a single compartment, as is the case of ISO 1101 of 2017</li> </ol> <p>The applicability hierarchy was conceived in such a way that the highest standards (general) also apply for the lowest (specific) ones.

Each and every GPS specification of a feature or relationship between features applies by default to the entire feature or features; each GPS specification applies only to one feature or one relation between features. Indications which specify that a requirement applies to more than one feature, e.g. when the CZ (combined tolerance zone) indication is used, are available.</p></li> <li><p>Independency principle (Sect. 5.5): each and every GPS specification of a feature or relation between features should by default be fulfilled independently of any other specifications, except when a special indication is specified.</p></li> <li><p>Default principle (Sect. 5.7): each specificGPSinvokes a series of rules that were pre-defined in other standards (default). A rule (the most common) is univocally pre-defined in the GPS system, and it can be omitted from the drawing in order to prevent overloading it. Pre-defined rules can be left out from the drawing by introducing symbols or others (modifiers) defined in the GPS system or even personalised within a company. For example, a 30H6 dimensioned hole (ISO 286\u20132) should defer to the definition of the tolerance of a diameter of a hole of between 30 and 30.016. As nothing else is specified, the diameter measured as the distance between two points is considered valid (ISO 14405\u20131).</p></li> <li><p>Reference condition principle (Sect. 5.8): all GPS specifications apply by default for a standard reference temperature of 20 \u00b0C, as defined in ISO 1, and the workpiece should be free of contaminants.</p></li> <li><p>Rigid workpiece principle (Sect. 5.9): each component is considered as an infinite rigid body that is not affected by any external force. A workpiece should by default be considered as having infinite stiffness, and all GPS specifications apply in the free state, and as undeformed by any external forces, including the force of gravity. A rigid body is a component that does not deform or bend by a quantity that prevents it from functioning under the effects of forces and/or the mounting constraints. Mention is also made of free state, that is, all the dimensions and the specified tolerances are applied without the action of any force other than gravity. When the workpiece is flexible, this should be indicated on the design (ISO 10579-NR).</p></li> <li><p>Duality principle (Sect. 5.10): the ISO GPS standards express duality between the specification and the verification.

Such control standards, which are appropriate in the case of mating, may be restrictive for all the other geometrical features, and may make it necessary, in the latter case, to furnish an indication of exception (the ASME standards have introduced the symbol, see Fig. 4.22), with the consequence of a source of ambiguity being created as it is not possible to ascertain whether the absence of such an indication depends on the choices of the designer or rather on an oversight within such a complex technical document.</p> <p>Apart from this problem, the verification of the envelope principle, which requires the use of functional gauges1 or controls carried out by means of measurement machines that have been set up and evaluated in an adequate way, is not an easy task.</p> <p>Table 4.2 shows a summary of the main differences between the two principles.

The mating size concept is instead adopted in the ASME standards to describe the size of a feature, that is, all the points on a surface should fall within an envelope which has the maximum material dimensions (Fig. 4.26).</li> <li>The ISO standards express a \u201cduality\u201d between specification and verification. Whatever is done in the specification process is mirrored in the actual measurement process. This is described as the \u201cduality principle\u201d. The ASME standard intentionally distanced itself from the measurement and control process. In fact, in clause 1.6 of ASME Y14.5\u20132018, the standard states that \u201cThis document is not intended as a gaging standard. Any reference to gaging is included for explanatory purposes only. For gaging principles, see ASME Y14.43 Dimensioning and Tolerancing Principles for Gages and Fixtures\u201d. In other words, the ASME standard describes the acceptable geometry of a part, and not how the part might be measured.</li> <li>The ISO standard is described as \u201cCMMfriendly\u201d, that is, the preferred control system is the coordinate measurement machine. The ideal or nominal geometry is defined in the design process, and the resulting workpiece is the real one in the manufacturing process. The control phase \u201cextracts\u201d the geometry of the physical workpiece in order to elaborate the geometrical features associated with the surfaces (planes, spheres, cylinders) and estimates the value of the measurement of interest (Fig. 2.2). The ASME standard is based on the idea of specifying the geometrically perfect zones within which the real surfaces should be found. This is often referred to as a preference for \u201chard gauging\u201d, that is, it is possible to construct functional gauges that represent a physical representation of the tolerance zone (Fig. 4.27).</li> <li>About 150 distinct standards have been issued in the ISO ambit to define the GPS language, while, since back in the 60s, only a single standard has been developed to define the fundamental rules for the functional dimensioning of components, with the objective of creating a well-defined and coherent normative system, which gave rise to the ASME Y14.5 standard of 2018 (328 pages, Fig. 4.28).</li> <li>Another important difference pertains to the stability of the standards: the ISO standard is in continuous evolution, with many changes, sometimes contradicting the previous standards: starting from 2010, the number of standards has grown enormously. Instead, in the ASME ambit, a new GD&amp;T standard is issued every 10\u201315 years.</li> <li>The tolerances of position and orientation of a feature of size in the ISO standards are applied to an extracted median line and surface, while, in ASME, they are applied to ideal (of derived) features, such as axes and centreplanes. For this reason, it is recommended to always indicate the reference standard in the technical drawings of companies, in that, as can be seen in the case of the parallelism tolerance shown in Fig. 4.29, the control of the error leads to two different results: control of the derived median line in the ISO standards and control of the axis in the ASME standard [4].</li> <li>Another non-negligible difference is the use of a comma as the decimal separation in the ISO standards and a dot in the ASME standards (Fig. 4.30).</li> <li>Finally, in the ISO standards, use is made indifferently of the control of a location or profile to locate and orientate a surface, while in the ASME standards, the location tolerance is only used for features of size (Fig. 4.31).  Fig. 4.25 The effect of two different default principles as outlined in the ISO and ASME standards. The dimensional and geometrical tolerances in the ISO drawing lead to an extreme boundary condition of 10,4 mm (10 + 0,4) and the roundness error may be greater than the dimensional tolerance.

In ISO, the 4 holes in Fig. 4.32 with the \u201c4x\u201d specification do not establish a pattern.

Consequently, the codification associated with the functional geometrical variations of the macro- and micro-geometries of workpiece specifications needs to be unambiguous and complete. An ever increasing requirement of accuracy has been observed in the description and in the interpretation of the functional requirements, and, consequently in the drawing up of the technical designs and documents in the mechanical subcontracting sector, which must be coherent and complete and able to adequately support the co-design and outsourcing requirements of a production.</p> <p>In addition, the rapid development of the coordinatemeasuring technique indicates that some specifications based on measurements with gauges and calibres, that were used in the last quarter of the XXth century, may be interpreted differently and produce different measurement results.</p> <p>Today, the importance of international standards in the technical documentation field is growing at the same rate as the globalisation of production; a simple, clear, univocal and concise three-dimensional description of the designed components is therefore necessary.</p> <p>For this reason, a remarkable effort is under way to develop a coherent and innovative management scheme of geometric tolerances, in order to obtain a better definition of the correlation between the functional requirements, geometrical specifications and relative control procedures, which can be summarised as the Geometrical Product Specification\u2014GPS and Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing\u2014 GD&amp;T principles, and which, if implemented correctly and coherently, allow the drawbacks of the present methodologies to be overcome and intra and inter-company communication to be revolutionised.</p> <p>Although the discussion of the new rules pertaining to the GD&amp;T methodology is put off until the next section, it is here considered opportune to recall some basic definitions in the context of what is now defined, in the rules and in practice, as GPS, that is, Geometrical Product Specification.</p> <p>Geometrical product specifications (GPS) defines a number of new concepts that have the potential of revolutionising the specification and verification domain, thereby enabling a designer to completely and unambiguously express the functional requirements in the technical documentation of products.</p> <p>The basic tools of the GPS language are given in the ISO 17450 and ISO 14660 standards. According to the ISO 14660/1 standard, the geometrical features can be found in three domains:</p> <ul> <li>the specification domain, where several representations of the future workpiece are imaged by the designer;</li> <li>the workpiece domain, that is, the physical world domain;</li> <li>the inspection domain, where a representation of a given workpiece is used through the sampling of the workpiece with measuring instruments.</li> </ul> <p>Table 2.1 shows some basic concepts of ISO 14660/1, which are often referred to in the ISO 17450/1 standard as the definitions of integral, associated and derived features.</p> <p>An integral feature is a geometrical feature that pertains to the real surface of a workpiece or to a surface model. An associated feature is an ideal feature that is established from a non-ideal surface model or from a real feature through an association operation. A derived feature is a geometrical feature that does not exist physically on the real surface of a workpiece, but which can be established from a nominal feature, an associated feature, or an extracted feature. The centre of a sphere is a derived feature obtained from a sphere, which is itself an integral feature. The median line of a cylinder is a derived feature that is obtained from the cylindrical surface, which is an integral feature (Fig. 2.1). The axis of a nominal cylinder is a nominal derived feature.</p> <p>In metrology, through the use of a CMMmeasuringmachine, the extracted feature (integral or derived, that is, an approximated representation of the real feature, which is acquired by extracting a finite number of points) is obtained from the real integral feature (Fig. 2.2). A perfect associated feature (a cylinder or the derived axis, which can be used, for example, as a datum) can thus be obtained from the extracted features.</p> <p>Table 2.1 Relationship of the three domains and the feature types Fig. 2.1 Illustration of the process adopted to build an extracted median line: an extracted median line is a set of 2D-associated centres Fig. 2.2 The ISO 14660/1 standard provides terms that allow an engineer to understand the impact of the drawing specifications on inspection. A nominal integral feature is a theoretically exact feature that has been defined in a technical drawing. A nominal derived feature is an axis that has been derived from one or more integral features. Extracted and associated features are parts of the inspection domain. An associated integral feature is an integral feature of a perfect form associated with the extracted integral feature. An associated derived feature is an axis or centerplane of a perfect form.</p> <p>The \u201cworld\u201d of manufacturing disappears in ISO 17450/1:2011, where it is replaced by the \u201cworld\u201d of specification. ISO 17450 is in fact aimed at expressing the fundamental concepts on which the geometrical specification of workpieces can be based, including all the geometrical tools needed in GPS.</p> <p>According to this standard, the geometrical features exist in three \u201cworlds\u201d:</p> <ol> <li><p>the nominal definition world, where an ideal representation of the workpiece is defined by a designer with a perfect form, i.e. with the shape and dimensions necessary to meet the functional requirements (Fig. 2.3). This workpiece is called the \u201cnominal model\u201d, and it is impossible to produce or inspect since each manufacturing or measuring process has its own variability or uncertainty.</p></li> <li><p>the specificationworld, where a designer, from the nominal geometry, imagines a model of this real surface, which represents the variations that could be expected on the real surface of the workpiece. This model, which represents the imperfect geometry of the workpiece, is called the \u201cnon-ideal surface model\u201d. The nonideal surface model is used to simulate variations of the surface at a conceptual level (see Fig. 2.4), thereby optimising the maximum permissible limit values for which the function is downgraded but still ensured. Thesemaximum permissible limit values define the tolerances of each characteristic of the workpiece.</p></li> <li><p>the verification world, where a metrologist defines the sequence of operations that will be used during the measuring process. Themetrologist reads the specification of the non-ideal surface model, in order to define the individual steps of the verification plan, (i. e. the mathematical and physical operations of the sampling of the workpiece). The measurement, through the so-called duality principle defined in ISO 17450\u20131, can mirror the specification operation for operation. Conformance is then determined by comparing the specified characteristics with the result of the measurement (see Fig. 2.5).</p></li> </ol> <p>The specification process is the first process to take place in the definition of a product or a system. The purpose of this process is to translate the designer\u2019s intent into a requirement or requirements for specific GPS characteristics. The designer is responsible for the specification process, which comprises ensuring the following steps (Fig. 2.6):</p> <ol> <li>feature functionality, i. e. the desired design intent of the GPS specification;</li> <li>GPS specification, which consists of a number of GPS specification elements each of which controls one or more specification operations;</li> <li>specification operations, which are defined as an ordered set of operations and can be thought of as a virtual measurement instruction, where each operation and the parameters that define such an operation are steps in the measuring process.  Fig. 2.4 The non-ideal surface model is used to simulate variations of the surface at a conceptual level, thus optimising the maximum permissible limit values for which the function is downgraded but still ensured</li> </ol> <p>Aspecification operator is necessary to define, for example, a possible specific \u201cdiameter\u201d in a cylinder (two-point diameter, minimum circumscribed circle diameter, maximum inscribed circle diameter, least squares circle diameter, etc.), instead of the generic \u201cdiameter\u201d concept. A specification involves expressing the field of permissible deviations of a characteristic of a workpiece as the permissible limits. There are two ways of specifying the permissible limits: by considering the dimension or by specifying the zone that limits the permissible deviation of a non-ideal feature inside a space.</p> <p>This is a new, more complicated approach than the previous methodologies, but it offers the designer more opportunities and more powerful tools to define the expected functional requirements with the maximum allowed tolerance.</p> <p> Fig. 2.5 The GPS duality principle pertaining to the specification and verification procedures: the metrologist reads the specification of the non-ideal surface model, in order to define the individual steps of the verification plan.

The form of an isolated feature is correct when the distance of each of the points of an ideal geometric surface, which are in contact with the datum, is equal to or less than the indicated tolerance; it should be pointed out that the tolerances on the profiles constitute a group on their own, in that they not only establish the limits of variation of the absolute form, but also the location and orientation of a surface or of any line, with respect to a possible datum.</p></li> <li><p>Orientation tolerances, which establish the limits of variation of a surface o a single feature with respect to one or more features assumed as a datum.

The symbols are explained in more detail later on.</p> <p>As can be seen from the table, some non-associable tolerances (for instance, planarity, roundness, etc.) do not refer to other features of a part, taken as a datum; some geometrical characteristics require a datum (such as parallelism or the location of a hole) and other tolerances that may ormay not be associated with another feature, such as tolerances on profiles.</p> <p>In other words, while a form error concerns an isolated feature (such as a flat surface), an orientation or location error is associated with another feature of the workpiece, which is known as the datum feature (more details of which will be presented in the next sections, together with details on how such a feature should be indicated). In short, a geometrical tolerance defines a space (either bi-dimensional or three-dimensional)within which the feature that has to be controlledmust remain. For example, a feature of a plane, forwhich one wishes to control the straightness, should remain within the area defined by two straight parallel lines at the same distance as the tolerance value; the tolerance zone in the 3D space should be a cylinder with a perfectly straight axis and generatrix, and with the diameter equal to the tolerance value.</p> <p>Some typical forms of tri-dimensional

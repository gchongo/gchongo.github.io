# 4. The GPS and GD&T Language

## Abstract 
<p align="justify">This chapter is focused on the main differences between the ISO and ASME standards in the geometrical specification domain of the industrial products, and it starts with details on the historical evolution of the two standards. The main principles of the ISO GPS and ASMEGD&Tstandards, such as the principle of independence and the envelope requirement, are illustrated. Designers are recommended to always indicate the reference standard in the technical drawings of companies, as the interpretation of drawing specifications and the relative inspection may lead to two different results. Finally, the main novelties of the new ASME Y14.5:2018 standard and the new ISO 22081 standard on general tolerances are shown.</p>
## 4.1 Historical Evolution of the ISO and ASME Standards
<p align="justify">The current industrial situation is characterised more and more by a continuous evolution towards increasingly dynamic interaction models between clients and suppliers that put traditional technical communication methodologies under greater pressure.</p>
<p align="justify">An always increasing requirement of accuracy in the description and in the interpretation of the functional requirements, and consequently in the drawing up of the technical designs and documents in the mechanical subcontracting sector, which are coherent and complete and able to adequately support the co-design and outsourcing requirements of a production, has been observed.</p>
<p align="justify">For this reason, a remarkable effort is underway to develop a coherent and innovative management scheme of geometric tolerances, in order to obtain a better definition of the correlation between the functional requirements, geometrical specifications and relative control procedures,which can be summarised as the Geometrical Product Specification—GPS and Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing – GD&T principles, and which, if implemented correctly and coherently, allow the drawbacks of the present methodologies to be overcome and intra and inter-company communication to be revolutionised.</p>
<p align="justify">The GPS and GD&T methodologies have evolved according to two basically different approaches (Fig. 4.1). A single standard was developed in the ASME standard, at the end of the 1960’s, to define the fundamental regulations for functional dimensioning. The objective was that of creating a clearly defined and coherent normative system, which gave rise to the ASME Y14.5 standards of 1994 and 2009, and the ASME Y14.5 standard of 2018.</p>

### 4.1.1 The Birth of Tolerances
<p align="justify">The world’s first tolerance standard of limits and fits made use of by industry was published in 1902 in the United Kingdom by the Newall Engineering Co.. In 1901, the UK established the world’s first standardisation organization, the Engineering Standards Committee (which, in 1931, became the British Standards Institution, BSI) and which issued its first standard on limits and fits in 1906. This standard involved the use of a standard sized shaft with various sizes of holes to establish the various types of fit. The standard, which was not initially regarded favourably by industry, since it was based on a shaft basis, was revised in 1924 on basis of the holes.</p>
<p align="justify">In the United States, five engineering societies and three government agencies founded the American Engineering Standards Committee (AESC) in 1918, which then became the American Standards Association (ASA) in 1928 and which was reorganised as the United States of America Standards Institute (USASI) in 1966. Finally, the USASI became the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1969. The first standard on limits and fits was the American Tentative Standard Tolerances, Allowances, and Gages for Metal Fits, B4a-1925 which contained tables that listed eight series of fits between holes and shafts, each fit being specified by the limits of size for each of the two mating parts.</p>
<p align="justify">The InternationalFederation of the National Standardizing Associations (or International Standards Association, ISA),was established in 1926, and one of the earliest projects was the development of an international system of limits and fits, which was published in 1941 as “ISA Tolerance System” with all the data inmetric units. Several European countries adopted this system as the basis of their national standards.</p>
<p align="justify">After the conclusion of World War II, a new organisation, the United Nations Standards Coordinating Committee (UNSCC), was established by the United States, Great Britain and Canada to extend the benefits of standardisation to the work of reconstruction. In October 1946, ISA and UNSCC delegates from 25 countries met in London and agreed to join forces to create the new International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO). The new organisation, ISO, officially began operations in February 1947 with its first office in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>
<p align="justify">In the same period, in theUnited States the geometrical tolerances language started as a military standard, known as US Army 30–1–7, dated April 15th, 1946, and was then updated as Mil-Std-8 in 1949.</p>
<p align="justify">The American Society ofMechanical Engineers (ASME), a non-profit organisation which was founded in 1880, is one of the oldest standards-developing organisations in America. In 1957, ASME published the first dimensioning and tolerancing standard, that is, Y14.5–1957 for ASA. Subsequent revisions of the Y14.5 standard have been published as USASI (Y14.5–1966) and ANSI (Y14.5–1973 and Y14.5–1982).</p>
<p align="justify">The revised ASME Y14.5 M-1994 (“M” because metric units were included) was approved as an ASME standard and, after fifteen years, was followed by ASME Y14.5–2009. The current version is ASME Y14.5–2018, and it was released in February 2019. The objectives of each version have been to correct any inconsistencies in the previous edition through the work committees made up of volunteers from academia and industry.</p>
<p align="justify">Since its foundation, ISO has developed many standards in the field of geometric tolerances such as the ISO 8015 standard in 1985 (principle of independence) and the ISO 1101 standard in 1969 (form and position tolerances).</p>
<p align="justify">In the ISO ambient of the 1990’s, starting from the consideration that 50% of the standards necessary for GD&T dimensioning were not available or were even in contradiction with the other existing standards, the international technicalscientific community was stimulated into searching for a new, more general and richer language, constructed on the basis of rigorous mathematical assumptions, that is, the aforementioned GPS.</p>
<p align="justify">In 1993, ISO set up the Joint Harmonisation Group (ISO/TC 3-10-57/JHG), in which the pre-existing technical committees, that is, ISO/TC3 (Surface Texture), ISO/TC10 (Dimensioning and Tolerancing) and ISO/TC57 (Measurement) were joined together in order to prepare a new standard. Between 1993 and 1996, the Joint Harmonisation Group developed the plant philosophy of the new language and, in 1995, the ISO/TR 14638:1995 “Masterplan” document was issued, which contains, among others, the proposal of a new paradigm for the classification of the existing and future standards, starting from the consideration that 50% of the standards necessary for GD&T dimensioning are not available or that they contradict other existing standards.</p>
<p align="justify">In 1996, the Joint Harmonisation Group was disbanded in Paris and the ISO/TC 213 technical Committee was set up. Some American representatives of the ASME Y14.5 committee took part in ISO committee meetings until 1999, after which they stopped attending because of controversies connected to the definition of certain geometrical concepts in the two normative systems, which adopt very different approaches, in spite of some apparent analogies.</p>
## 4.2 The GPS Matrix Model
<p align="justify">The objective of the new language was that of expressing and transmitting, in a rigorous formal manner, all the functional requirements of the products, in order to guarantee functionality, reliability, verifiability and interchangeability. GPS is considered as a shared language between worlds that are often separate, that is, the design, production and the control worlds and, for the first time in the history of standards, it compares designers with metrologists. The ISO/TR 14638:1995 Masterplan document, which was issued in 1995 as a summary of the work of the Joint Harmonisation Group, was drawn up to outline the guidelines for ISO/TC 213. In fact, the Masterplan, which was later approved as the Global GPS Standard, ratifies the new paradigm for the classification of GPS standards. The entire system is known as the “GPSMatrixModel”, and it takes on the role of a “container” of the GPS standards by acting as a matrix in which the lines refer to the geometrical properties of the product (for example, the form or location), while the columns represent the links or, in other words, a specific application ambit of the standards in the context of the development cycle of a product, from its conception to its final control (Fig. 4.2).</p>
<p align="justify">A table is formed by crossing these dimensions: the GPS matrix, in which each standard is characterised by 2 coordinates (the properties and the production process step). A standard can often refer to more than one property, or to different steps of the production process; it can therefore take up an area of the matrix and not just a single cell. Each standard of the system includes a final attachment with the exact location of the standard in the matrix, which is indicated with a filled dot (Fig. 4.3).</p>
<p align="justify">In the new Masterplan outlined in ISO 14638 of 2015, the GPS standards are classified as:</p>
1. <p align="justify">Fundamental, that is, standards which define the rules and principles that apply to all categories and which occupy all the segments of the matrix (ISO 8015, ISO 14638).</p>
2. <p align="justify">General, that is, ISO GPS standards that apply to one or more geometrical property categories, and to one or more chain links, but which are fundamental (ISO 1101, ISO 5459).</p>
3. <p align="justify">Complementary, that is, ISO GPS standards that refer to specific manufacturing processes (for example, turning) or to specific machine elements (for example, bolts).</p>

<center>Fig. 4.3 Each standard is characterised by 2 coordinates in the matrix, but can often refer to more than one property, or different steps of the production process, and may thus occupy an area of the matrix rather than just a single compartment, as is the case of ISO 1101 of 2017</center>
<p align="justify">The applicability hierarchy was conceived in such a way that the highest standards (general) also apply for the lowest (specific) ones. For example, it is not necessary to specify the reference temperature in ISO 1101 (general, geometrical tolerance) as UNI ISO 1 (fundamental) is valid.</p>

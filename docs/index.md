# Welcome CAXer

<p align="justify">This website is my personal depository for learning notes, dedicated to chronicling my expertise and insights in the realms of mechanical design, manufacturing processes, and finite element analysis. </p>
<p align="justify">These domains form the bedrock of my professional expertise and are central to my career trajectory. Beyond these technical pursuits, I am also keen to share my personal interests in history, cinema, music, and technology. These subjects not only broaden my intellectual horizons but also serve as topics that I am eager to engage with others.</p>

The website is currently organized into three main sections: CAD, CAE, and COX. 

CAD, which stands for Computer-Aided Design, is a hub where I gather my reflections and learnings on mechanical design. 

CAE, for Computer-Aided Engineering, encompasses resources related to finite element analysis and product manufacturing processes. 

COX, or 'Cage of X', is a catch-all category  where 'X' symbolizes everything, capturing my explorations and contemplations on a diverse array of topics including history, technology, and literature. 

Naturally, I hold the ultimate authority for the interpretation and categorization of these contents.  As my interests grow and my knowledge deepens, the website's directory may also expand to include new categories.
